\section{Introduction}
Video games have become one of the most prevalent forms of entertainment among adolescents across the globe,
with violent and death-related content present in many popular titles (\textit{e.g. Call of Duty, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto}).
 Existing rating systems such as PEGI (EU) and ESRB (US) already flag the degree of violent realism in these games,
 reflecting widespread public concern about the effects of such content on young people's development and moral reasoning.

 \subsection{Background and significance}
 Debates about whether violent video games contribute to aggressive attitudes or behavior have persisted for as long as such games exist.
 Meta-analyses and longitudinal studies have produced mixed results, with some finding small to none effects on aggression, whilst others
 suggest that frequent exposure to violent or dark-themed games may increase tolerance toward aggression and reduce empathic concern for
 others \cite{anderson2007violent}.
