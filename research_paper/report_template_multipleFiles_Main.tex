\begin{abstract}
Violent and death related content in video games raises concerns about potential impacts on adolescents' moral reasoning, emotional responses and behavioural tendencies.
This study investigated whether exposure to violent video game content influences these developmental domains in North Thine-Westphalia, Germany. A total of 118
adolescents (aged 12-20) and an approximately equal number of parents completed structured questionnaires assessing gaming habits, engagement patterns, genre preferences,
emotional responses to in-game violence and behavioural aggression tendencies.

Results revealed moderate gaming engagement (57\% playing 0.5-3 hours daily) with substantial exposure to violent content, particularly shooters (61\% engagement).
Gender differentiation was pronounced with males reporting significantly higher enjoyment of violent gameplay (85\% vs. 76\% combined; 62\% vs. 42\% consistent enjoyment).
Gaming demonstrated predominantly social characteristics (67\% with substantial peer interaction). Regarding behavioural outcomes, 70\% of parents reported no aggression
increase or actual decrease following gaming, while 30\% observed increases (23\% moderate, 7\% significant).

Evaluation of three research hypotheses derived from desensitization and aggression frameworks yielded limited support for Hypothesis 1 (violent game exposure correlates
with higher aggression/ reduced empathy), insufficient measurement for Hypothesis 2 (reward system amplification) and robust support for differential exposure, but
limited outcome differentiation in Hypothesis 3 (gender effects). THe dissociation between high in-game violence enjoyment (76\%) and predominantly unchanged real-world
aggression suggests adolescents maintain psychological boundaries between fictional gameplay and real-world moral domains - a phenomenon termed \textit{compartmentalization}
(\cite{Békés_Ferstenberg_Perry_2018}).

However the 30\% experiencing aggression increases, particularly the 7\% with significant escalation, indicates that violent content demonstrably affects a substantial
minority. These heterogenous outcomes challenge linear dose-response media effects models and suggest that protective factors (social gaming, moral development, individual
differences) substantially buffer against predicted negative effects for most adolescents. THe findings necessitate reconceptualization of media effects frameworks
emphasizing domain-specific emotional calibration and individual heterogeneity rather than uniform desensitization trajectories. Practical implementations emphasize
informed parental engagement, media literacy education and ethically sophisticated game design over categorical content prohibition.
